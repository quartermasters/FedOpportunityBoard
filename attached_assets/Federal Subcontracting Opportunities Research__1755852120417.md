## **Executive Summary: The GovCon Subcontracting Advantage**

The United States federal government represents the single largest consumer market in the world, with contract awards reaching $773.68 billion in fiscal year 2024\.1 A significant portion of this immense spending is directed toward small businesses, which received $176.11 billion in contracts in FY24, an increase of nearly $4 billion from the previous year.1 While a new market entrant may find it challenging to secure prime contracts directly, the federal procurement ecosystem is structured to facilitate entry through subcontracting.

Subcontracting is not a peripheral activity; it is a strategic imperative driven by both regulation and business necessity. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines require large prime contractors with contracts exceeding certain thresholds to develop and execute formal subcontracting plans.2 This regulatory mandate transforms large businesses from competitors into potential partners, as they are actively seeking qualified small businesses to help them fulfill their contractual obligations and meet their small business utilization goals.3

This report provides a comprehensive guide for new entrants to the government contracting (GovCon) market, offering a roadmap for identifying and engaging with prime contractors. It moves from a high-level analysis of market dynamics to a detailed exploration of key contracting vehicles and a step-by-step framework for establishing profitable, long-term relationships. By concentrating on high-value, multi-award contracts—specifically Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) and Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts—this guide directs a new entrant's focus toward the most promising sources of subcontracting opportunities.

The following table offers a quick reference to some of the most prominent contracting vehicles and their key characteristics, which will be discussed in detail throughout this report.

| Contract Vehicle | Administering Agency | Primary Scope | Contract Ceiling / Value |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| OASIS+ | GSA | Professional Services | No stated ceiling |
| SEWP V | NASA | IT Products & Product-Based Services | $20B per contract |
| 8(a) STARS III | GSA | IT Services (exclusively for 8(a) firms) | $50B |
| Alliant 2 | GSA | IT Services | No stated ceiling |
| SeaPort-NxG | DoD (Navy) | Engineering & Program Management | $5B |
| ITES-3S | Army (CHESS) | IT Services & Solutions | $12.1B |
| DLA JETS 2.0 | DoD (DLA) | IT Services | $6B |

## **Chapter 1: The Federal Contracting Landscape: Market Dynamics and Key Vehicles**

### **Market Context and Trends**

The federal contracting market is a vast and dynamic ecosystem with consistent and predictable spending patterns. In FY24, federal contract awards totaled $773.68 billion, marking a minor decrease from the previous year but continuing a long-term trend of growth since FY19 when total awards were approximately $598 billion.1 This sustained level of investment indicates a stable environment ripe with opportunities for businesses of all sizes.

An analysis of contract awards by agency reveals a concentration of spending within a few key departments. The defense sector, led by the Department of the Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), consistently accounts for the largest share of federal contracts, comprising nearly 60% of all awards in FY24.1 Other major agencies with significant procurement volumes include the Department of Veterans Affairs, NASA, the Department of Energy, and the General Services Administration (GSA).1 These agencies are crucial for new entrants to monitor, as their substantial budgets drive a high volume of contracting activity.

The types of services and products procured are similarly concentrated. The top North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes reflect a high demand for Professional Services, Information Technology (IT), Facilities & Construction, Medical, and Research & Development (R\&D) services.1 Notably, the Engineering Services NAICS code (541330) is widely used across both construction and IT sectors, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of many federal projects.1

### **Decoding GovCon: The Mechanics of Multi-Award Vehicles**

To navigate the federal market effectively, a new entrant must first understand the primary mechanisms through which the government procures goods and services. While some contracts are awarded on a one-off basis, an increasing portion of federal spending is channeled through sophisticated, multi-year contract vehicles known as Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts and Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs).1

An IDIQ contract is a framework under which the government can order supplies or services for a stated period without predetermining a precise quantity or exact delivery schedule at the time of award.6 The government commits to ordering at least a minimum quantity but can order up to a stated maximum over the contract's lifetime.6 A GWAC is a specific type of IDIQ that is designed for use by all federal agencies across the government.7

The strategic significance of these vehicles for a new entrant is profound. Rather than issuing a separate solicitation for every need, which is an administratively intensive process, agencies use a single, pre-competed GWAC or IDIQ to streamline procurement.6 This approach consolidates billions of dollars in spending into a limited number of "super contracts," making them a central hub of activity. For a new entrant, this means the most efficient path to finding work is not to sift through a scattered landscape of individual contracts but to gain access to the massive flow of work created by these specific vehicles through subcontracting.

Furthermore, some of these contracts are designated as "Best-in-Class" (BIC), a special status from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that identifies them as a preferred, or even first-choice, procurement option for federal agencies.10 This designation is a powerful signal to a new entrant, indicating that vehicles like STARS III and SEWP V are likely to attract a disproportionately high volume of federal spending.

### **Subcontracting: A Strategic Imperative**

For businesses new to the GovCon market, subcontracting provides a low-barrier entry point to the federal ecosystem. It enables a company to build a record of past performance, which is a key criterion for winning future prime contracts, without shouldering the full administrative and financial responsibilities of a prime.12 By working under an established prime, a new entrant can learn the nuances of federal compliance, project management, and reporting.2

The regulatory framework of the federal government further reinforces the importance of subcontracting. The FAR stipulates that federal contracts awarded to large businesses above a certain dollar threshold must include a small business subcontracting plan.2 This plan requires the prime contractor to set and meet specific goals for awarding subcontracts to small businesses, including those in various socioeconomic categories such as small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB).2

The existence of these regulatory requirements creates a critical opportunity for new entrants. It means that large prime contractors are not merely open to working with small businesses; they are legally obligated to find and partner with them.2 This transforms the relationship from a passive one into an active search, where primes are consistently looking for qualified subcontractors to help them meet their legal and contractual commitments. A new entrant's strategy, therefore, should be proactive and targeted, positioning itself as a valuable solution to a prime contractor’s regulatory and operational needs.

## **Chapter 2: Deep Dive into High-Opportunity Contracting Programs**

### **GSA OASIS+**

The One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus (OASIS+) is a government-wide, multi-award IDIQ contract designed to meet the professional services needs of federal agencies.14 As the successor to the highly successful OASIS contract, OASIS+ is a key vehicle for services-based solutions that are primarily noncommercial in nature.15 The contract allows for task orders to be awarded with all contract types, including Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) and Time and Materials (T\&M), and supports both classified and unclassified work within the continental U.S. and abroad.15

The contract's scope is organized into eight distinct domains, or functional groupings, which align with specific NAICS codes.15 These domains include:

* **Management and Advisory:** Services that improve agency performance and provide consulting on administrative and management issues.16  
* **Technical and Engineering:** The application of engineering and physical sciences to develop and design technical systems and processes.16  
* **Research and Development:** Support for R\&D activities across a range of scientific disciplines, from engineering to social sciences.16  
* **Intelligence Services:** Focuses on mission requirements related to Command, Control, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C3ISR).16  
* **Environmental:** Support for environmental initiatives, including remediation and legal consulting.16  
* **Facilities:** Services for maintaining and operating real property assets, from DOD installations to hospitals.16  
* **Logistics:** Solutions for the movement and operation of supplies, equipment, and personnel.16

A significant feature of OASIS+ is its structure, which includes separate and distinct IDIQ contracts for various business sizes and socioeconomic categories.14 This means there are specific contract pools for Total Small Business, Women-owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, 8(a) Small Business, and an Unrestricted pool.14 This segmentation is a direct benefit to a new entrant, as it allows a small business to target prime contractors on the specific vehicle for which they hold a certification. A complete list of apparent contractor awardees is available in a downloadable format, providing an immediate and actionable list of potential partners.17

### **NASA SEWP V**

The NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V contract is a BIC GWAC focused on IT products and product-based services.11 Administered by NASA, this vehicle is available for use by all federal agencies and authorized federal agency support service contractors.18 The contract has a substantial ceiling value of $20 billion per contract and was awarded to 147 prime contractors, including 120 small businesses.11

The scope of SEWP V is explicitly defined. Its primary purpose is to deliver IT products, which can include hardware, software, cybersecurity solutions, and cloud services.18 A key distinction of this vehicle is that labor services are limited in scope and are intended only to support the products being purchased, such as installation, training, or initial implementation.19 The value of these labor services cannot exceed 10% of the total price of the associated equipment on a given task order.19 This is a critical nuance for a new entrant; a services-focused firm must understand that opportunities on this vehicle are constrained by the product component.

The NASA SEWP program office provides an online Quote Request Tool, which is the recommended method for agencies to request quotes from prime contractors and ensure fair opportunity.19 The use of this tool simplifies the procurement process for agencies and allows primes to easily identify opportunities. For new entrants, understanding this process is essential for positioning their services or products as a valuable addition to a prime contractor's offerings.

### **GSA 8(a) STARS III**

The GSA 8(a) Streamlined Technology Acquisition Resource for Services (STARS) III is a BIC GWAC specifically reserved for Small Business Administration (SBA)-certified 8(a) prime contractors.10 With a program ceiling of $50 billion, this contract is a cornerstone of the federal government’s effort to meet its 8(a) socioeconomic utilization goals.10 The contract's scope is centered on IT services and IT services-based solutions, including the integration of emerging technologies.10

For an 8(a) firm, winning a spot on the STARS III contract is a significant achievement that offers a number of advantages, including access to directed task orders of up to $4.5 million with limited protestability, which significantly accelerates the procurement process and reduces competition.10 The contract also provides a minimum guarantee of $250 per awardee, ensuring that every prime contractor receives at least a nominal amount of work.22

For new entrants who are not SBA-certified 8(a) firms, the STARS III vehicle still represents a major opportunity. Because the scope is so broad—covering IT operations, cybersecurity, software development, and new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation (RPA)—8(a) prime contractors often need to supplement their capabilities with specialized subcontractors.10 A new entrant can strategically position itself as an expert in a niche area to multiple STARS III primes, offering a win-win scenario: the subcontractor gains a foothold in the market and a record of past performance, while the prime contractor gains the expertise required to win and execute on task orders.

### **Other Essential Multi-Award Vehicles**

While OASIS+, SEWP V, and STARS III are central, several other major contract vehicles are also critical sources of subcontracting opportunities. These contracts, often managed by the Department of Defense, operate with similar multi-award IDIQ structures.

* **DoD SeaPort-NxG:** Administered by the Department of the Navy, this multi-award IDIQ is a primary vehicle for a wide range of engineering and program management support services.24 With an estimated ceiling of $5 billion, it covers a broad scope of services for the Navy, Marine Corps, and other federal agencies.9 The extensive list of awarded primes, which includes hundreds of contractors, highlights the vast potential for subcontracting partnerships.24  
* **Army ITES-3S:** The Information Technology Enterprise Solutions-3 Services (ITES-3S) is a $12.1 billion MA-IDIQ managed by the U.S. Army's Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) program.9 The contract is available to the Army, other DoD agencies, and all other federal agencies worldwide.23 ITES-3S primes often have large and diverse teams of partners, with some publicly listing their subcontractors.23 The contract's scope includes a full range of IT services, from cybersecurity and cloud hosting to supply chain management and business process reengineering.26  
* **DLA JETS 2.0:** The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) J6 Enterprise Technology Services (JETS) 2.0 contract is an IT-focused IDIQ with a $6 billion ceiling.27 The recent award of this contract to over 80 firms, including major players like Leidos and Booz Allen Hamilton as well as a large number of smaller businesses, creates a new and vibrant market for subcontracting.28 The contract's focus on technology and cybersecurity reflects the DLA's role in managing the military's global supply chain.

## **Chapter 3: Identifying and Engaging with Prime Contractors**

### **A New Entrant's Toolkit: Data-Driven Research**

A successful subcontracting strategy begins with a data-driven approach to market research. A new entrant must move beyond simply knowing which contracts exist and pinpoint which primes are winning work that aligns with their specific capabilities. Publicly available government databases provide the necessary intelligence to achieve this.

* **SAM.gov:** The System for Award Management (SAM) is the official portal for federal contract opportunities over $25,000.30 A new entrant can use this system to search for active solicitations and identify the agencies issuing them.  
* **FPDS-NG and USASpending.gov:** The Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and USASpending.gov are repositories of historical federal contract data.31 These systems allow a user to analyze which agencies are buying what, with whom they are contracting, and the dollar values of those awards.31

A strategic approach to using these tools involves a methodical process of discovery. A new entrant can first use FPDS-NG to find agencies that have a history of spending in their specific NAICS code.1 Next, they can analyze which of the large IDIQs and GWACs discussed in this report are being used by those agencies. Finally, they can use the same databases to identify the specific prime contractors who are winning the most work on those vehicles, thereby creating a targeted list of high-probability partners for outreach.31

### **Establishing Contact and Building Relationships**

Once a target list of prime contractors has been developed, the next step is to initiate contact and establish a professional relationship. This process requires a strategic, multi-faceted approach that demonstrates a business's value proposition.

* **The Capability Statement:** A concise and compelling capability statement is a new entrant's primary marketing document.12 This document must highlight the firm's strengths, past performance, and how its services can fill a gap in a prime contractor's existing team or enhance their ability to win a specific opportunity.12 A well-crafted statement should be tailored to the prime's specific needs, showcasing an understanding of their business and the contracts they hold.  
* **Proactive Outreach:** A successful outreach strategy uses multiple channels. It should include direct email contact with the prime contractor’s small business liaison, whose information is often available on the company’s website.3 Beyond this, engaging with industry associations and attending industry days or government-sponsored matchmaking events can provide invaluable networking opportunities to connect with decision-makers.12  
* **Supplier Portals:** A crucial step in this process is registering in a prime contractor’s supplier or subcontractor database.3 Companies like Booz Allen Hamilton 4, Leidos 34, and General Dynamics 35 all maintain dedicated portals for this purpose. Registration serves as a pre-qualification step and allows primes to find a new entrant when they need a specific capability to bid on a task order.32 A new entrant that registers its business, provides all required documentation, and maintains a comprehensive profile is demonstrating its professionalism and readiness to comply with the prime's internal processes.

The following table provides a sample list of key prime contractors and a direct path to their supplier registration portals, serving as a tangible starting point for a new entrant's outreach efforts.

### **Networking and Matchmaking**

Beyond online research and direct outreach, a physical presence at industry events can accelerate the relationship-building process. Many federal agencies and large prime contractors host industry days and matchmaking events with the express purpose of connecting with small businesses.32 These events provide an opportunity for face-to-face interaction, which can be invaluable for making a lasting impression.

Furthermore, a number of government-funded programs exist to provide no-cost assistance to small businesses. The APEX Accelerators, formerly known as Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs), are a prime example.38 Funded in part by the Department of Defense, these centers offer advising, training, and a wealth of resources to help businesses navigate the complexities of government sales.39 They can serve as a vital guide for a new entrant, providing personalized assistance and local networking opportunities.

## **Chapter 4: A Compendium of Resources and Prime Contractor Lists**

### **Official Government Resources for Small Businesses**

* **SBA's Subcontracting Network (SubNet):** SubNet is a centralized, public database where large businesses with federal contracts and subcontracting plans can post opportunities for small businesses.41 Small businesses can search and view these postings without the need for registration.2 While some sources suggest it is not heavily used, it remains an official and valuable part of the small business toolkit.30  
* **SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS):** The DSBS is a database utilized by government agencies and prime contractors to identify potential small business partners for upcoming contracts and teaming arrangements.31 A company's profile in the DSBS is populated directly from its registration in SAM.gov.31 It is therefore critical for a new entrant to ensure its SAM profile is comprehensive, accurate, and includes a well-written capabilities narrative, relevant NAICS codes, and keywords that reflect its services.2  
* **Agency Small Business Offices:** Most federal agencies have an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) or a similar office.31 These offices are dedicated to identifying opportunities for small businesses, often publishing procurement forecasts and hosting events to connect small businesses with prime contractors.31

### **Prime Contractor Directory (Program-Specific Lists)**

Access to a complete list of awarded prime contractors for key vehicles is essential for a new entrant's research and outreach efforts. The following resources provide direct access to these lists:

* **GSA OASIS+:** For a comprehensive and up-to-date list of all awarded contractors, GSA provides a weekly updated spreadsheet.17 This XLSX file is a critical data source for a new entrant to analyze and target potential partners. The list is organized by the different contract pools, making it easy to identify which primes are on the Total Small Business or Unrestricted vehicles.17  
* **GSA 8(a) STARS III:** The GSA maintains an "Industry Partner Spreadsheet" on its website for the STARS III contract.45 This downloadable file contains contact information for all the 8(a) prime contractors on the vehicle, providing a direct channel for an IT-focused new entrant to begin its outreach.45  
* **DLA JETS 2.0:** The DLA JETS 2.0 IDIQ has a published list of all its awardees, with over 80 firms holding positions.28 The list includes both large and small businesses, which is a valuable detail for a new entrant looking to partner with a prime that is focused on meeting its socioeconomic goals.  
* **DoD SeaPort-NxG:** The list of awardees for the SeaPort-NxG contract is extensive, containing hundreds of contractors.24 This list is publicly available and provides a wide range of potential partners across the country.

## **Conclusion: Charting a Course for Success**

Entering the U.S. federal government contracting market through subcontracting is a viable and highly strategic path for new businesses. The market's scale, coupled with a regulatory environment that incentivizes large primes to seek out small business partners, creates a predictable flow of opportunity.

The analysis in this report provides a clear roadmap for a new entrant. The strategic focus should be on a select group of high-value, multi-award contracts, such as OASIS+, SEWP V, and STARS III. These vehicles serve as central hubs for federal spending and are where a new entrant's outreach efforts will yield the highest probability of success.

The final recommendations for a new entrant are as follows:

* **Register and Optimize:** A business must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) and ensure its Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) profile is comprehensive and keyword-rich. This is the first step toward being discovered by both government agencies and prime contractors.2  
* **Targeted Outreach:** A data-driven approach is paramount. Use public databases like FPDS-NG to analyze historical awards and identify a focused list of prime contractors on key contract vehicles.31 This targeted approach conserves resources and increases the likelihood of a successful partnership.  
* **Leverage Resources:** Utilize the wealth of free resources available to small businesses. This includes seeking guidance from APEX Accelerators and engaging with the small business offices of key federal agencies.31  
* **Embrace the Long View:** Subcontracting is a stepping stone. Each successful subcontracting project is an opportunity to build a past performance record, establish a reputation for reliability, and forge relationships that can one day facilitate the transition from a subcontractor to a successful prime contractor.

# **Strategy to Approach TLS Primes (SOE & F\&ESE)**

## **0\) Positioning Statement (use in all intros)**

* **What we do:** Niche, part-numbered supply \+ mission-ready kitting in \[select 1–2 niches from below\], with fast lead times, clean documentation, and disciplined pricing.

* **Why it matters to primes:** Lower admin friction, reliable fulfillment inside TLS rules, and OEM prices that keep them most competitive on task orders.

* **Risk posture:** We carry our note; primes have zero exposure on our side.

---

## **1\) Pick 1–2 wedges (don’t look like a generalist)**

Choose from these based on your OEM access and supply agility:

| Wedge (niche) | What we sell (examples) | Why primes care |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Marine lifesaving & flight-deck safety** | PFDs, immersion suits, lifelines, fall-arrest kits, deck safety kits | High compliance; recurring demand; fewer fast, reliable subs |
| **CBRNE / decon kits** | Disinfectant systems, responder decon packs, TCCC/IFAK add-ons | Steady F\&ESE buys; consultative value in kitting |
| **SAR / rescue** | Litters, ropes, pulleys, cutting tools, scene lighting | Cross-agency demand; kitting \= value add |
| **Comms support** | Headsets, ruggedized cables, mounts, PTTs, antenna kits | Keeps primes competitive on brand/PN-specific orders |
| **Firefighting consumables** | Hoses, nozzles, adapters, PPE adjuncts (not core turnout) | Fast-moving SKUs; margin via aggregation |

Pick no more than two; build deep OEM leverage and inventory predictability.

---

## **2\) OEM Strategy (the engine of “lowest delivered cost”)**

**Objective:** Walk in with **pre-negotiated OEM pricing** (or regional exclusivity) that lets the prime beat peers on competed delivery orders.

**Steps:**

1. **Map 10–15 OEMs** per wedge: SKU lists, MOQ, lead time, warranty, drop-ship ability, freight terms.

2. **Negotiate price ladders** (volume breaks), **90–120-day price locks**, and **RMA SLAs**.

3. **Get letters of supply** \+ reseller certs; confirm TAA/Berry where applicable.

4. **Create a “proof pack”** for each OEM: data sheet bundle, safety certs, HS codes, COO, item images, packaging specs.

Deliverable: a one-pager per OEM showing **landed cost, lead time, warranty**, and **drop-ship** capacity.

---

## **3\) Price & Margin Model (hit \~5% net at scale)**

**Cost stack you’ll show the prime (be transparent):**

* Ex-works OEM price

* Inbound freight \+ duties

* Packaging/Kitting labor (per kit)

* Overheads (small %)

* **Your fee** (keep lean; win on volume \+ stickiness)

**Guardrails:**

* Offer the prime a **menu**: (a) pass-through \+ small fee for simple resale; (b) higher fee for integration/kitting; (c) rush premium.

* Commit to **price discipline**: when the prime is competing, you adjust fee to win.

---

## **4\) Logistics & SLA Setup (match their Gold-tier expectations)**

**Targets to publish:**

* **OTD ≥ 98.5%**, ASN same-day on ship, tracking within 2 hours.

* **Lead-time tiers:** stock (48–72h), make/kit (7–14 days), long-lead (30–45 days).

* **QA/QC:** inbound inspection checklist, serial/lot capture, photos on pack-out, scan-verified contents.

* **Returns:** RMA within 24h, ship labels issued by next business day, credit \< 5 days post-receipt.

**Systems:**

* Light WMS \+ label printing \+ barcode scans; export packing lists in prime’s template.

* Maintain a **SKU master** (TAA/CoO, ECCN/ITAR flags, weights/dims).

---

## **5\) Compliance Pack (send with your intro)**

* **Corporate:** W-9, COI, banking/ACH, DUNS/UEI, NAICS alignment.

* **Trade:** TAA/Berry statements where applicable, ECCN/ITAR awareness statement.

* **Quality:** QMS SOPs (receiving, kitting, final QA), corrective action form.

* **Cyber:** Short statement on safeguarding CUI (basic NIST 800-171 posture; no claims you can’t support).

---

## **6\) Vendor Onboarding Artefacts (ready to drop in their portal)**

* 2-page **TLS-oriented capability statement** (wedge-specific).

* **Line card**: OEM logos \+ sample PN list (10–20 PN per OEM).

* **Sample quotes**: 3 mocked RFQs showing part-numbered items, lead times, and total landed cost.

* **Kitting sheets**: BOMs with photos, labels, UoM, cube/weight, and pack sequence.

---

## **7\) Outreach Plan (sequenced)**

### **Week 1–2: Prep**

* Finalize **2 wedges**, **10 OEMs**, and **logistics SLAs**.

* Build the **capability statement**, line card, compliance pack.

### **Week 3–4: Initial touches**

* **Email intro \+ capability** → ask for *vendor onboarding packet* and a **15-min discovery**.

* **Phone follow-up** in 48–72h.

* Target meetings around trade shows (AUSA, SOFIC) or DC availability.

### **Meeting agenda (15–30 min)**

1. “Where are your **coverage gaps** in SOE/F\&ESE right now?”

2. “Which brands/SKUs are **hard to source** at competitive net delivered cost?”

3. “Where does **kitting** save you the most touches?”

4. “What **EDI/portal** requirements should we align to from day one?”

5. “What does a **first win** look like for you—SKU count, timeline, location?”

### **After the call (48h)**

* Send a **tailored micro-catalog** (10–20 SKUs relevant to their gaps) with indicative pricing and lead times.

* Offer a **pilot** (one kit or a small PN set) on **aggressive terms** to prove speed \+ accuracy.

### **30–60 days**

* Convert the pilot → gather metrics (OTD, fill rate, issue rate \= zero).

* Request to be **first-look** on matching RFQs within your niche.

* Expand SKU coverage and inventory depth based on their demand pattern.

## **8\) Prime-by-Prime “Angle of Attack”**

| Prime | What to lead with | How to de-risk for them |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **ADS** | Broad catalog gaps \+ kitting; align to their quality culture | Show ISO-like QMS, fast RMA, and picture-verified pack-outs |
| **Federal Resources** | **CBRNE/comm kits**, consultative buys | Offer kit-BOM engineering \+ decon SOPs; TAA/Berry clarity |
| **Quantico Tactical** | **C4ISR accessories**, shelters/genset adjuncts; speed | Publish OTD target ≥ 98.5%; same-day ASN/tracking; rush cell |
| **SupplyCore** | **F\&ESE consumables** and rescue kits | Promise steady forecast \+ stock for hoses/nozzles/adapters |
| **TSSi** | **Kitting-first**: SAR/medical/CBRNE kits; scalable pack line | Show you can surge staff and document kit QA with photos |
| **W.S. Darley & Co.** | **Marine lifesaving & flight-deck safety** adjuncts; complementary items | Emphasize TAA/Berry compliance and packaging that matches their OEM quality |

---

## **9\) Pilot Design (make it impossible to say “no”)**

* **Scope:** 1 kit (or 10–20 SKUs) in 10 business days.

* **Included:** Photo-verified BOM, barcode labels, packing list in their template, serial/lot capture, and a zero-cost rework promise if we miss.

* **Price:** Keep fee razor-thin; the *point* is proof \+ trust → volume later.

---

## **10\) Metrics you share monthly (earn “trusted” status)**

* Order count, **OTD**, average cycle time, returns/RMA (target 0), ASN timeliness, damage rate (target 0), documentation errors (target 0).

* **Continuous improvement log:** what we fixed, how, and resulting delta.

---

## **11\) Risks & Mitigations (they’ll ask)**

* **Long-lead OEM parts:** Pre-buy small safety stock for top 20 SKUs; dual-source when possible.

* **Price volatility:** 90–120-day OEM price locks; escalation clause tied to freight/fuel index.

* **QC failure risk:** Two-step inspection \+ photographic evidence \+ rework SLA.

* **Compliance gaps:** Maintain a TAA/Berry tracker per SKU; stop-ship rule if status changes.

---

## **12\) 90-Day Execution Plan**

**Days 1–14**

* Pick 2 wedges; lock 10 OEMs; assemble compliance pack; finalize SLAs.

* Build capability statement \+ line card \+ pilot kit BOM with photos.

**Days 15–30**

* Outreach to 6 primes; book 4 discovery calls; adjust wedge SKUs from feedback.

* Prepare 3 pilot quotes with **landed cost** and **lead times**.

**Days 31–60**

* Execute 1–2 pilots; achieve ≥98.5% OTD, 0 errors.

* Formalize onboarding with 2 primes (vendor portal, terms, ACH, return policy).

**Days 61–90**

* Expand SKUs \+ inventory depth; add second wedge (if traction).

* Negotiate first-look on matching RFQs in your wedge; target 2 repeat orders.

# **GSA OASIS+: Navigating the Future of Federal Professional Services Procurement and the FY2025 On-Ramp**

**1\. Executive Summary**  
The U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services Plus (OASIS+) represents a significant evolution in federal procurement, establishing a next-generation, Best-in-Class (BIC) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle portfolio for complex professional services. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the OASIS+ program, with a particular focus on the continuous on-ramping process anticipated to be fully operational in Fiscal Year (FY) 2025, offering ongoing opportunities for government contractors.  
Key highlights of the OASIS+ program include its expanded scope, which consolidates and builds upon legacy contracts such as OASIS, Building Maintenance & Operations (BMO), and Human Capital & Training Solutions (HCaTS), to deliver a comprehensive suite of non-IT services. A pivotal feature is the introduction of a continuous open solicitation, or "on-ramping," commencing after the initial award phases. This mechanism, expected to be a defining characteristic from FY2025 onwards, is designed to allow new industry partners to qualify and secure a position on OASIS+ at any time, provided they meet the stringent criteria.  
OASIS+ is engineered to streamline procurement for federal agencies while enhancing access for highly qualified contractors. It places a strong emphasis on maximizing small business participation through dedicated set-aside contracts. Core benefits underpinning the program's attractiveness include the absence of a contract ceiling, broad accessibility for federal agencies, a flexible domain-based structure for service categorization, and the mandatory use of GSA eBuy for task order solicitations.  
For government contractors, understanding the intricacies of OASIS+ is a strategic imperative. The shift towards a continuous on-ramping model signals a fundamental change in GSA's procurement strategy. This approach aims to foster greater dynamism within the federal marketplace and ensure a consistently refreshed industrial base capable of meeting evolving government needs. While this model presents sustained opportunities for entry and growth, it also cultivates a persistently competitive environment. Contractors must be prepared not only to meet the initial qualification hurdles but also to continuously demonstrate value and innovation to thrive within the OASIS+ ecosystem. The ability of GSA to manage an ongoing evaluation process will also be a factor in how quickly new applicants can be brought onto the vehicle.  
**2\. Understanding the GSA OASIS+ Contract Vehicle**  
The GSA OASIS+ program is not merely an update to previous contracting mechanisms; it is a strategically redesigned suite of contracts intended to address the federal government's evolving requirements for complex professional services. Its structure and objectives reflect a deliberate effort to enhance efficiency, access, and value in federal procurement.  
**2.1. Genesis and Strategic Importance: Evolution from Legacy Contracts**  
OASIS+ has its roots in the lessons learned and successes of several prominent GSA contract vehicles, most notably the original OASIS contracts, as well as the Building Maintenance & Operations (BMO) and Human Capital & Training Solutions (HCaTS) programs. By consolidating and expanding upon the scope of these legacy vehicles, GSA aims to simplify the acquisition landscape for a wide array of non-IT professional services. This consolidation is driven by the persistent need within the federal government for a more adaptable, comprehensive, and streamlined method for procuring services that are often multifaceted and demand integrated solutions.  
A critical aspect of OASIS+'s strategic importance is its designation as a Best-in-Class (BIC) solution. This designation, conferred by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), signifies that OASIS+ meets rigorous criteria for performance, value, and efficiency. It encourages federal agencies to utilize OASIS+ to meet their spend under management (SUM) goals, making it a preferred and attractive option for government buyers seeking quality and efficiency in their service acquisitions. The BIC status inherently signals a level of trust and reliability in the contract vehicle, which can accelerate adoption across federal agencies.  
The table below highlights key distinctions between OASIS+ and its predecessor, the legacy OASIS program, offering a clearer understanding of the advancements incorporated into this new vehicle.  
**Table 1: OASIS+ vs. Legacy OASIS \- Key Differences**

| Feature | Legacy OASIS | OASIS+ |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Scope** | Professional services, organized by size standard into pools of unrelated NAICS codes. | Professional and other Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS) covered services, organized by related services into domains of individual NAICS codes. |
| **On-ramping/Solicitation Strategy** | As-needed on-ramping (no further on-ramps due to contract closeout). | Solicitations will re-open in FY25 and will be continuously open to receive offers. |
| **Evaluation Methodology** | Accepted Highest Technically Rated offerors with a Fair and Reasonable Price (HTRFRP) and offerors with the highest scores. | Will accept All Qualified Offerors with a Fair and Reasonable Price who meet the qualifying threshold of project and corporate-level criteria. |
| **NAICS Code Assignment (Master Contract)** | One NAICS assigned per pool. | One primary NAICS code is assigned per contractor’s contract. Multiple Contract Line Items (CLINs) and corresponding NAICS codes within each Domain. |
| **Contract Structure** | 19 total IDIQ contracts (Small Business, 8(a), Unrestricted). | Six IDIQ Contracts (Unrestricted, Small Business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB). |
| **Ordering Tools** | Uses multiple programs. | Uses one tool, GSA eBuy. |
| **Small Business Rerepresentation** | Required 120 days prior to exercising the option. | Required 120 days prior to the five-year anniversary of the individual contract. |
| **Task Order Period of Performance Extension** | Not explicitly highlighted as a key difference. | Task order Period of Performance can extend up to five years and six months beyond the ordering period of the master contract. |

**2.2. Core Objectives and Intended Benefits for Federal Agencies**  
OASIS+ is designed with the federal agency customer at its core, aiming to address several key procurement challenges:

* **Fulfilling Complex Needs**: The primary objective is to provide federal agencies with a single, versatile solution for acquiring complex and integrated non-IT service requirements that often span multiple professional disciplines.  
* **Streamlined Procurement**: OASIS+ seeks to simplify the buying experience for federal agencies. This is achieved through standardized master contract terms and conditions and the mandatory use of the GSA eBuy platform for all task order solicitations, which promotes efficiency and transparency.  
* **Access to Qualified Contractors**: The vehicle is structured to offer agencies access to a broad, diverse, and highly qualified industrial base. This includes a significant emphasis on facilitating access to various categories of small businesses, ensuring a robust pool of potential solutions providers.  
* **Promoting Value and Competition**: By fostering a competitive environment among these qualified service contractors, OASIS+ aims to enable agencies to achieve the best possible value in fulfilling their mission outcomes.  
* **Data-Driven Insights**: A key benefit for agencies is access to transactional data and data analytics capabilities. This allows for more informed spend analysis and market research, contributing to smarter procurement decisions over time.

**2.3. Key Structural Elements: IDIQ Types, Contract Duration, and Overarching Features**  
The architecture of OASIS+ is fundamental to its operational effectiveness and broad appeal:

* **IDIQ Structure**: At its heart, OASIS+ is a collection of multiple-award IDIQ contracts. This structure provides inherent flexibility for both agencies and contractors.  
* **Distinct Contract Tracks (Set-Asides)**: OASIS+ comprises six separate and distinct IDIQ contracts, catering to different segments of the industrial base: Unrestricted, Total Small Business, SBA-Certified 8(a) Small Business, SBA-Certified HUBZone Small Business, SBA-Certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and SBA-Certified Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB). This multi-track approach is central to GSA's objective of maximizing small business participation and providing targeted opportunities.  
* **Contract Duration**: Each OASIS+ master contract has a five-year base period, with one five-year option period, allowing for a cumulative ordering period of up to 10 years. Notably, task orders issued under OASIS+ can have periods of performance that extend up to five years and six months beyond the expiration of the master contract's ordering period, providing continuity for long-term projects.  
* **No Contract Ceiling**: A significant feature of OASIS+ is the absence of an overall program ceiling or any cap on the value of individual task order awards. This offers immense scalability and makes the vehicle suitable for even the largest and most complex federal service requirements, a major attraction for both agencies and contractors.  
* **Broad Agency Access**: OASIS+ contracts are available for use by all federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). However, they are not currently open to state and local governments. This wide accessibility greatly expands the potential market for OASIS+ awardees.  
* **Global Geographic Scope**: The vehicle supports service requirements performed both within the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).  
* **Flexible Task Order Contract Types**: At the task order level, OASIS+ accommodates all contract types, including Fixed-Price (all variations), Cost-Reimbursement (all variations), Time & Materials (T\&M), Labor Hour (LH), and hybrid approaches that blend multiple types.

The comprehensive structural design of OASIS+, encompassing multiple socio-economic tracks, the absence of a spending ceiling, broad agency utilization, and support for diverse task order types, clearly indicates GSA's ambition. The agency intends to establish OASIS+ as a highly versatile and widely adopted "go-to" vehicle for professional services across the federal government. This strategic positioning aims to capture a substantial portion of federal expenditure in these service areas, thereby enhancing procurement efficiency, oversight, and the achievement of socio-economic contracting goals. The inclusion of five distinct small business set-asides, in particular, underscores a commitment to channeling significant federal spending towards these enterprises, offering them targeted avenues for growth.  
**3\. Navigating the OASIS+ Domains and Scope**  
A fundamental organizing principle of OASIS+ is its "Domain" structure. These Domains are functional groupings of related non-IT services, with each Domain encompassing multiple North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. This approach represents a significant shift from the "Pool" structure of the legacy OASIS contracts, which were often organized by size standards and could include unrelated NAICS codes. The Domain structure is intended to provide clearer alignment between agency requirements and specific contractor capabilities.  
**3.1. Detailed Breakdown of Service Domains**  
OASIS+ features several distinct Domains, each catering to a broad category of professional services:  
**Table 2: OASIS+ Domains Overview**

| Domain Name | Brief Description (Key Service Areas) | Example NAICS Codes (Illustrative) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Management and Advisory (M\&A)** | Improving agency performance, meeting mission goals, operating advice, administrative/management issues. | 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting), 541618 (Other Management Consulting), 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) |
| **Technical and Engineering (T\&E)** | Specific engineering, geoscience, technical skills; application of physical laws/engineering principles in design, development, utilization of systems. | 541330 (Engineering Services), 541310 (Architectural Services), 488190 (Other Support Activities for Air Transportation) |
| **Research and Development (R\&D)** | Basic research, applied research, experimental development in physical, engineering, life sciences, nanotechnology, biotechnology, social sciences/humanities. | 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences), 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) |
| **Intelligence Services (INTEL)** | Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) mission requirements; improving situational awareness, command/control strategies. | 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services), 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services) \- *Specific Intel NAICS are often sensitive and may be detailed in solicitations.* |
| **Environmental (ENV)** | Meeting environmental requirements; air/water quality, contamination, remediation, ecological restoration, environmental law. | 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services), 562910 (Remediation Services) |
| **Facilities (FAC)** | Maintaining/operating buildings, paved services, utilities infrastructure, real property assets/equipment (excluding major/primary purpose construction). | 561210 (Facilities Support Services), 541350 (Building Inspection Services) |
| **Logistics (LOG)** | Comprehensive logistics solutions: planning, design, implementation, operation for movement of supplies, equipment, people by various transport modes. rtation) |  |
| **Enterprise Solutions** | Large-dollar, wide-reaching, highly complex requirements spanning multiple disciplines/locations. (Unrestricted Only) | Overlaps with other domains but distinguished by scale/complexity. Includes 541330, 541611, 541715, 561210 etc. |

*Note: The example NAICS codes are illustrative and not exhaustive. Offerors should always refer to the official OASIS+ solicitation documents for the definitive list of NAICS codes associated with each Domain.*  
**3.2. In-Focus: The Enterprise Solutions Domain – Scope, Requirements, and Target Contractors**  
The Enterprise Solutions Domain stands apart due to its specific focus on exceptionally large, complex, and high-impact federal projects.

* **Purpose and Scope**: This Domain is tailored for procurements that are large-dollar, wide-reaching (often across an entire agency or multiple organizations), and highly complex, frequently spanning multiple service disciplines and geographic locations. It is intended for requirements involving highly technical work, new and emerging technologies, or specialized mission objectives that demand significant management attention and oversight due to their importance to an agency's mission, high development or operational costs, inherent risks, potential for high returns, or their critical role in the administration of agency-wide programs and resources.  
* **Exclusivity**: The Enterprise Solutions Domain is exclusively available under the OASIS+ Unrestricted contract vehicle. This reflects the scale and financial capacity typically required for such endeavors.  
* **Minimum Task Order Threshold**: A defining characteristic of this Domain is a substantial minimum total estimated value for task orders. For instance, information indicates a minimum order threshold of $250 million (total estimated value including base and all option periods) for task orders issued through this Domain. This threshold ensures that the Domain is reserved for truly enterprise-level undertakings.  
* **Target Contractor Profile**: The Enterprise Solutions Domain is designed for contractors possessing the demonstrable capability to manage vast and intricate projects. This includes experience with highly specialized requirements, managing multi-layered subcontracting teams, accountability for significant contractor-acquired or managed government property, robust accounting and estimating systems, stringent quality control programs, geographically dispersed project offices, and the capacity for significant upfront capital investment.  
* **Associated NAICS Codes**: While the Enterprise Solutions Domain addresses a unique scale of complexity, its NAICS codes often overlap with those found in other Domains. The distinction lies in the magnitude and intricacy of the task orders rather than entirely unique service types. Key NAICS codes associated with this Domain include, but are not limited to: 336611 (Ship Building and Repairing), 541330 (Engineering Services, including its exceptions for Military and Aerospace Equipment, National Energy Policy Act contracts, and Marine Engineering/Naval Architecture), 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services), 541614 (Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services), 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services), 541690 (Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services), 541715 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, including its exceptions for Aircraft and Guided Missiles/Space Vehicles), 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services), 561210 (Facilities Support Services), and 562910 (Remediation Services, including its exception for Environmental Remediation Services).

**3.3. NAICS Code Alignment and Task Order Applicability**  
The assignment and use of NAICS codes are critical to the functioning of OASIS+:

* **Principal Purpose NAICS Code**: For every task order issued under OASIS+, the Ordering Contracting Officer (OCO) is responsible for determining the appropriate NAICS code that describes the principal nature of the service being acquired. This selected NAICS code must align with one of the NAICS codes listed under the specific OASIS+ Domain being solicited. This ensures that task orders are correctly categorized and directed to contractors qualified within that service area.  
* **Primary NAICS at Master Contract Level**: For administrative and reporting purposes within systems like the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), each OASIS+ master contract is assigned a single primary NAICS code. This assignment, however, does not restrict a contractor's eligibility to respond to task order solicitations or perform work under any other NAICS code for which they hold an award within their qualified Domain Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  
* **Fair Opportunity Pools**: Contractors are eligible to compete for task orders within the specific Domain CLINs (which represent groupings of NAICS codes) for which they have received an OASIS+ award. These CLINs effectively define the contractor's fair opportunity pools.  
* **FPDS System Limitation**: It is important to note that FPDS is currently designed to accept only one NAICS code to be associated with a procurement action (like a task order award). This is a limitation of the FPDS system itself and does not impact the OCO's ability to assign the most appropriate NAICS code to the task order based on its principal purpose, nor does it affect a contractor's eligibility within their awarded domains.

The domain-based structure, coupled with the requirement for NAICS code alignment at the task order level, facilitates a more precise match between agency needs and contractor capabilities compared to previous contract structures. This system allows for broad categorization of services at the Domain level while enabling specific targeting of expertise through NAICS codes for individual requirements. Consequently, prospective offerors must engage in a strategic analysis of their core competencies and, critically, their portfolio of Qualifying Experience Projects (QEPs) to determine which Domains (and associated NAICS codes) offer the highest probability of successful award and future task order capture. A misaligned Domain strategy could result in significant wasted proposal effort. The Enterprise Solutions Domain, with its substantial threshold and complexity, presents a distinct and highly specialized opportunity track, primarily for very large and exceptionally capable contracting organizations.  
**4\. The OASIS+ FY2025 On-Ramp: A Continuous Opportunity**  
One of the most transformative features of the OASIS+ program is its commitment to a continuous open solicitation process, commonly referred to as "on-ramping." This mechanism is poised to redefine how contractors access this major IDIQ vehicle, particularly from FY2025 onwards.  
**4.1. Confirmation and Mechanics of the Continuous Open Solicitation Process**  
A cornerstone benefit and a key differentiator of OASIS+ is that, following the initial phases of contract awards, the solicitations are designed to remain continuously open. This "open season" approach allows new industry partners who meet the qualification criteria to submit proposals and potentially obtain OASIS+ contracts at any time. This marks a significant departure from the periodic and often infrequent on-ramping opportunities characteristic of legacy OASIS and many other traditional IDIQ contracts.  
GSA has explicitly and consistently communicated its plans to reopen the OASIS+ solicitations for this continuous on-ramping process in FY2025. This provides a clear pathway for companies that may not have participated in the initial solicitations or for those who were initially unsuccessful but have since strengthened their qualifications. These prospective offerors are actively encouraged by GSA to continue developing their proposals in readiness for submission once the solicitations formally reopen under the continuous on-ramping framework.  
**4.2. Anticipated Timelines and Key Milestones for FY2025 On-Ramping**  
While precise dates for the FY2025 on-ramp re-opening will be formally announced by GSA, the general timeline has been outlined:

* **Completion of Initial Awards**: The initial rolling awards for the various OASIS+ contract tracks (Total Small Business, Unrestricted, and the socio-economic set-asides including HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, and 8(a)) were largely made in late calendar year 2024, which corresponds to Q1 of FY2025 for the federal government. These award processes continued into Q2 FY2025 as GSA finalized evaluations and issued Notices to Proceed (NTPs). For example, OASIS+ Small Business awards and NTPs were issued around December 19, 2024, with Unrestricted awards occurring in groups around December 6 and December 17, 2024\. Socio-economic awards saw initial NTPs around September/October 2024, with further rolling awards planned into FY2025.  
* **Solicitation Re-opening in FY2025**: GSA has consistently indicated that the OASIS+ solicitations will re-open in FY2025 to implement the continuous on-ramping mechanism. Contractors should anticipate formal announcements providing specific dates and instructions for this re-opening.  
* **Notices to Proceed (NTPs) for New Awardees**: Similar to the initial awardees, companies that successfully qualify through the continuous on-ramping process will receive NTPs, officially marking the beginning of their contract performance period and eligibility to compete for task orders.

**4.3. How to Stay Updated: Leveraging GSA Interact, SAM.gov, and Official Announcements**  
Given the dynamic nature of the continuous on-ramping process, it is crucial for prospective offerors to stay informed through official GSA channels:  
**Table 3: Key Resources for OASIS+ Information**

| Resource Name | Primary Purpose/Information Available | Web Link (Official GSA Sources) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **OASIS+ Interact Community** | Latest news, program updates, training schedules, Q\&A, community collaboration, official announcements. | Accessible via GSA Interact (buy.gsa.gov/interact) |
| **SAM.gov (System for Award Management)** | Official solicitations (RFPs), amendments, award notices, and related procurement documents. | SAM.gov |
| **GSA OASIS+ Website** | Central repository for program information, buyer/seller guides, FAQs, domain details, comparison to legacy OASIS, links to other resources. | gsa.gov/oasis-plus |
| **OASIS+ Submission Portal (OSP) / Symphony** | Platform for proposal submission, Q\&A during open periods, and managing proposal-related communications. | Access details typically provided in solicitation documents or via GSA announcements. |
| **GSA eBuy** | Platform for reviewing awarded vendors and for issuing/receiving task order solicitations (RFIs, RFPs). | ebuy.gsa.gov |

Additionally, offerors should ensure that their contact information is current in relevant systems and that they are set up to receive email notifications from gsa.gov to avoid missing important updates.  
The introduction of a continuous on-ramping mechanism fundamentally alters the strategic timeline and approach for contractors targeting OASIS+. Instead of preparing for distinct and often widely spaced "RFP seasons," OASIS+ becomes an ongoing consideration. This necessitates a shift towards a state of perpetual readiness, where companies must continuously monitor the procurement landscape, assess their qualifications against evolving requirements, and maintain up-to-date market intelligence. This model implies that a company doesn't have to wait for a specific future on-ramp announcement if the solicitations are indeed continuously open; they can theoretically prepare and apply when they determine they meet the qualifications. This transforms proposal preparation from a project-based effort into a more sustained, strategic function within the business.  
**5\. Eligibility and Evaluation for OASIS+ On-Ramping**  
Securing a place on an OASIS+ contract through the on-ramping process requires a thorough understanding of both the eligibility criteria and the specific evaluation methodology employed by GSA. The approach for OASIS+ signifies a move towards a more objective, qualifications-based assessment.  
**5.1. General Eligibility Criteria for Unrestricted and Small Business Tracks**  
While specific details will be outlined in the reopened solicitations, general eligibility criteria based on the initial RFPs include:

* **Business Size and Type**: A primary determinant for eligibility is the offeror's business size and any applicable socio-economic certifications. OASIS+ has distinct contract tracks for Unrestricted businesses and various small business categories (Total Small Business, WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a)). Offerors must meet the SBA's size standards for the NAICS codes relevant to the Domains they are pursuing under the appropriate contract track.  
* **Domain-Specific Qualifications**: Offerors must demonstrate relevant experience and qualifications for each specific Domain they propose. This is primarily achieved through the submission of Qualifying Experience Projects (QEPs) that meet stringent criteria related to scope, size, complexity, recency, and relevance to the Domain's service areas.  
* **System for Award Management (SAM) Registration**: As with all federal contracting, current and active registration in SAM.gov is a fundamental requirement. GSA has issued amendments to OASIS+ solicitations to incorporate updated FAR provisions related to SAM registration, underscoring its importance.  
* **Past Performance**: A satisfactory record of past performance is a critical evaluation factor. This is typically assessed through Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings and other verifiable sources of past performance information. The solicitations have provided methods for offerors to demonstrate past performance even when CPARS information does not exist for a particular project.  
* **Financial Capability**: Offerors may be required to demonstrate adequate financial resources and stability to perform on a contract of the magnitude of OASIS+. The GSA Form 527, Contractor Qualifications and Financial Information, has been part of the provisional attachments.  
* **Required Certifications and Documentation**: Offerors must possess and provide evidence of various corporate-level certifications and other documentation as stipulated in the solicitation. This can include business licenses, quality management system certifications (e.g., ISO 9001), and other credentials relevant to the services offered and domains pursued.

**5.2. Understanding the Evaluation Methodology: "All Qualified Offerors" Approach**  
OASIS+ employs an evaluation methodology that differs significantly from some legacy contracts:

* **Shift from Legacy OASIS Evaluation**: The legacy OASIS contracts often utilized an evaluation approach such as "Highest Technically Rated offerors with a Fair and Reasonable Price (HTRFRP)" or a system based on achieving the highest overall score. This could involve more subjective trade-offs between technical merit and price.  
* **OASIS+ "All Qualified Offerors" Philosophy**: In contrast, OASIS+ is designed to award contracts to "All Qualified Offerors". This means that any offeror who successfully meets all the predefined qualifying thresholds for project-level experience (QEPs) and corporate-level criteria, and whose proposed pricing is determined to be fair and reasonable, should be eligible for an award. This approach aims for broader inclusion of all competent contractors.  
* **Self-Scoring Mechanism**: A key component of the OASIS+ proposal process, as evidenced in the initial solicitations, is a self-scoring mechanism. Offerors are typically required to complete a scorecard or matrix, claiming points based on their QEPs, certifications, and other qualifications. The accuracy and meticulous substantiation of every point claimed are paramount, as GSA will rigorously verify these claims.  
* **Price Evaluation**: Price evaluation is conducted at the master contract level to ensure fair and reasonable pricing. Specific methodologies for price evaluation are detailed in the solicitation.

**5.3. Key Elements of a Successful Proposal: Qualifying Experience Projects (QEPs), Past Performance, Certifications, and Self-Scoring**  
Success in the OASIS+ on-ramping process hinges on the meticulous preparation and presentation of several key proposal elements:

* **Qualifying Experience Projects (QEPs)**: QEPs are the bedrock of an OASIS+ proposal, serving as the primary evidence of an offeror's capability and experience within the targeted Domains. These projects must meet highly specific criteria detailed in the solicitation, often relating to project value, period of performance, scope relevance to the Domain, and complexity. The inability to provide a sufficient number of compliant QEPs is a common reason for proposal failure.  
* **Data Verification and FPDS**: GSA places significant emphasis on verifying the project data submitted by offerors, frequently cross-referencing information with government databases such as the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). Any discrepancies between an offeror's claims and official records can jeopardize the validity of a QEP and, consequently, the entire proposal.  
* **Past Performance Substantiation**: Strong past performance, evidenced by positive CPARS ratings and other verifiable documentation (such as the Past Performance Rating Form provided in solicitations ), is crucial. Offerors must ensure their past performance record accurately reflects their capabilities and commitment to quality.  
* **Comprehensive Attachments and Forms**: The OASIS+ solicitations require the submission of numerous specific attachments and forms. These can include Project Verification Forms (signed by the client for each QEP), templates for Joint Venture experience, detailed Cost/Price templates, and various certifications. Failure to complete and submit these accurately and completely can lead to non-compliance.  
* **Absolute Compliance and Attention to Detail**: Given the "All Qualified Offerors" approach, meticulous attention to compliance with every instruction and requirement in the RFP is paramount. Unlike evaluations that might allow for minor deficiencies to be offset by other strengths, the OASIS+ methodology often means that failure to meet a specific threshold or provide a required piece of documentation can render a proposal ineligible.

The evaluation framework of "All Qualified Offerors," combined with a self-scoring system that is heavily dependent on verifiable QEPs and corporate credentials, fundamentally shifts the nature of proposal preparation. The emphasis moves from crafting persuasive narratives alone to a more rigorous process of meticulous data gathering, honest and accurate self-assessment, and unwavering compliance with all stated requirements. This creates a more objective evaluation landscape, but one that is also unforgiving of errors or omissions. The pre-proposal phase, dedicated to identifying, thoroughly vetting, and documenting QEPs and assembling all other required evidence, becomes disproportionately critical to success.  
**6\. Strategic Considerations for Prospective OASIS+ Offerors**  
Approaching the OASIS+ on-ramping opportunity requires more than just meeting the minimum qualifications; it demands a strategic, well-prepared, and forward-thinking approach. Lessons learned from the initial award rounds and the inherent complexities of the vehicle offer valuable guidance for prospective offerors.  
**6.1. Preparing for the Proposal: Lessons from Initial Awards and Common Challenges**  
The initial phases of OASIS+ awards highlighted several common challenges and underscored the importance of thorough preparation:

* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:  
  * **Insufficient or Non-Compliant QEPs**: Many firms struggled to identify and substantiate the required number of Qualifying Experience Projects that strictly met all solicitation criteria (e.g., value, scope, recency, relevance). Even a single missing or non-compliant QEP could undermine an otherwise strong bid due to the self-scoring, threshold-based evaluation.  
  * **Data Discrepancies**: Misalignments between a company's internal records for project experience and official government data sources like FPDS proved to be a significant hurdle. GSA's verification process often revealed discrepancies in reported contract values or periods of performance, jeopardizing the validity of claimed experience.  
  * **Leadership Misalignment on Proposal Effort**: Some senior leadership teams underestimated the nature of the OASIS+ proposal effort, expecting a traditional narrative-heavy process. The reality is that OASIS+ proposals are intensely data-driven, focusing on certifications, qualifications, past performance, and financial data, rather than extensive technical or management narratives.  
  * **Underestimation of Detail and Verification**: The sheer volume of data to be collected, verified, and meticulously documented was often overwhelming for businesses not adequately prepared for such an intensive, compliance-focused submission.  
* **Best Practices for Proposal Preparation**:  
  * **Start Early**: Given the time-consuming nature of data collection, QEP verification (including obtaining client sign-offs on Project Verification Forms), and internal reviews, an early start is crucial.  
  * **Develop Detailed Compliance Matrices**: Creating robust compliance matrices that break down all RFP requirements, qualification criteria, documentation needs, and self-scoring elements into manageable tasks is essential for tracking progress and ensuring nothing is overlooked.  
  * **Implement Rigorous Internal Review and Validation**: All data, claims, and supporting documentation must be subjected to thorough internal review and validation processes before submission to ensure accuracy and alignment with GSA's instructions.  
  * **Consider Proactive Subcontractor Engagement**: If internal QEPs or other qualifications are insufficient for desired Domains, proactively identifying and engaging with potential subcontractors to fill these gaps can be a viable strategy.  
  * **Educate Leadership**: It is vital to educate senior leadership on the specific data-centric requirements and compliance-driven nature of OASIS+ proposals to ensure alignment of expectations and timely support for critical approvals or clarifications.

**6.2. Leveraging Teaming Arrangements and Subcontracting**  
Teaming and subcontracting can play a significant role in strengthening an OASIS+ proposal:

* **Addressing Qualification Gaps**: Strategic teaming arrangements can be instrumental in addressing gaps in an offeror's QEP portfolio, expanding coverage across multiple desired Domains, or bolstering past performance records.  
* **Joint Ventures (JVs)**: For offerors considering a JV structure, OASIS+ solicitations have included specific templates (e.g., J.P-7 Joint Venture Work and Qualifications Template) and outlined processes for how JVs can claim and substantiate experience derived from member companies.  
* **Subcontracting Plans**: Particularly for bids on the Unrestricted track, offerors may be required to submit comprehensive subcontracting plans that detail their strategies for utilizing small businesses and other categories of subcontractors. Model subcontracting plans (e.g., J.P-10 Individual Model Subcontracting Plan, J.P-11 Commercial Model Subcontracting Plan) have been provided as part of the solicitation attachments.

**6.3. Aligning Capabilities with Specific Domains and Agency Needs**  
A critical strategic decision for prospective offerors is the selection of Domains:

* **Strategic Domain Selection**: Companies should conduct a rigorous self-assessment to identify the Domains where their core competencies, and most importantly, their strongest and most verifiable QEPs, align. It is generally advisable to focus on Domains where a high probability of meeting all qualification thresholds can be demonstrated, rather than overextending into areas with weaker qualifications.  
* **Understanding Agency Requirements**: Beyond qualifying for a Domain, successful contractors will need to understand the typical service requirements of federal agencies procuring services through those Domains. Ongoing market research into agency needs and procurement forecasts can help tailor future task order responses.  
* **Competitive Landscape Awareness**: Being aware of the companies already awarded contracts within target Domains, particularly those with similar capabilities, is important for understanding the competitive environment for future task orders. GSA has released lists of awardees for various phases and tracks.

**6.4. Long-Term Benefits of Securing an OASIS+ Contract**  
The significant upfront investment in preparing an OASIS+ proposal is justified by the substantial long-term benefits an award can offer:

* **Access to a Vast Market**: OASIS+ is positioned to capture a significant portion of the government-wide spend on professional services. The legacy OASIS program, for example, saw approximately $87 billion in obligations over its life , indicating the scale of opportunity.  
* **Streamlined Bidding for Task Orders**: Once awarded a master contract, companies gain access to a continuous stream of task order solicitations issued through the GSA eBuy platform, a more streamlined process than pursuing standalone contracts.  
* **Enhanced Credibility and Market Standing**: Holding an OASIS+ contract, particularly with its Best-in-Class designation, enhances a contractor's credibility and visibility within the federal marketplace.  
* **Significant Long-Term Revenue Potential**: With a potential 10-year ordering period, an OASIS+ contract offers a long-term avenue for revenue generation and business growth.

Achieving success on OASIS+ necessitates a fundamental shift in approach for many contractors. It requires moving beyond traditional proposal development methodologies towards a more data-centric, compliance-focused, and continuous readiness model. The "cost of entry," in terms of the meticulous preparation and resource allocation required, is undeniably high. However, the potential long-term rewards—access to a major government-wide contracting vehicle with a vast market and streamlined procurement processes—are substantial. Companies that invest in robust internal systems for tracking project performance, maintaining current certifications, managing financial records accurately, and institutionalizing a culture of compliance will find themselves at a distinct advantage, not only for OASIS+ but for the evolving landscape of data-driven federal solicitations.  
**7\. OASIS+ for Small Businesses: Enhanced Access and Opportunities**  
A cornerstone of the OASIS+ program is its robust framework for maximizing small business participation. GSA has structured the vehicle to provide diverse and significant opportunities for various categories of small businesses, reflecting a strong commitment to leveraging their capabilities in meeting federal service requirements.  
**7.1. Overview of Small Business Set-Aside Contracts**  
OASIS+ features a dedicated suite of contracts exclusively for small businesses, ensuring that these enterprises have tailored avenues to compete and win federal work:  
**Table 4: OASIS+ Small Business Contract Tracks**

| Contract Track | Eligibility Focus/Certification Required | Key Considerations for Offerors |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Total Small Business (TSB)** | Must meet SBA size standards for relevant NAICS codes within chosen Domains. | Broadest small business category; competition can be intense. Requires strong, verifiable QEPs across chosen Domains. |
| **8(a) Small Business** | Must be an active participant in the SBA's 8(a) Business Development Program. | Offers opportunities for competitive 8(a) set-asides and directed task order awards, aligning with agency 8(a) goals. |
| **HUBZone Small Business (HZ)** | Must be an SBA-certified HUBZone small business concern. | Targets businesses located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones, helping agencies meet HUBZone contracting goals. |
| **Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)** | Must be an SBA-certified (or VA-verified, as applicable by regulations at time of solicitation) SDVOSB. | Provides dedicated opportunities for veteran-owned businesses with service-connected disabilities. |
| **Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB)** | Must be an SBA-certified WOSB or Economically Disadvantaged WOSB (EDWOSB), as specified in the solicitation. | Focuses on increasing federal contracting opportunities for women-owned enterprises. |

These five distinct IDIQ contracts run parallel to the Unrestricted OASIS+ contract, creating a comprehensive structure that caters to a wide spectrum of the industrial base. Eligibility for each track is determined by adherence to the Small Business Administration's (SBA) size standards for the NAICS codes associated with the proposed Domains, as well as possession of the relevant and current socio-economic certifications.  
A nuanced but important detail for small businesses is how primary NAICS codes are assigned at the master contract level. For OASIS+ Small Business contracts, the primary NAICS code is typically selected based on the *largest* size standard among the NAICS codes within the contractor's awarded Domains. This approach is strategically designed to prevent small businesses from being inadvertently locked out of fair opportunity pools within their awarded Domains during the mandatory size re-representation process that occurs during the contract's lifecycle. This foresight helps ensure their continued eligibility to compete for work as long as they otherwise qualify.  
**7.2. GSA's Commitment to Maximizing Small Business Participation**  
GSA has explicitly stated that a key objective of the OASIS+ program is to maximize small business participation by removing barriers to entry and helping customer agencies acquire the best professional services solutions from these vital enterprises. This commitment is not merely aspirational; it builds upon a strong track record. For instance, the legacy OASIS contracts saw approximately 40% of their total $87 billion in obligations directed to small businesses, translating to nearly $35 billion in opportunities. OASIS+ is designed to sustain and potentially enhance this level of small business engagement.  
Within their respective set-aside contract tracks and awarded Domains, small businesses will compete for task orders under fair opportunity procedures. This structure provides a more level playing field, allowing small businesses to compete against similarly situated firms, rather than directly against much larger corporations in all instances.  
The multi-faceted small business strategy embedded within OASIS+, characterized by five distinct set-aside contract vehicles, demonstrates a deliberate and significant effort by GSA. This structure is designed to channel a substantial portion of federal spending on professional services towards the various recognized categories of small businesses. This offers diverse entry points and targeted opportunities for these firms. However, it also implies that small businesses, especially those eligible for multiple socio-economic certifications (e.g., a company that is both a WOSB and an SDVOSB), must make careful strategic decisions. As noted in some industry analyses, contractors must submit separate offers for each Master Contract they wish to pursue. Given the significant effort involved in preparing an OASIS+ proposal, small businesses will need to carefully assess their resources and strengths to determine which contract track(s) offer the best alignment and probability of success.  
**8\. Conclusion and Future Outlook**  
The GSA OASIS+ contract vehicle portfolio stands as a cornerstone of the federal government's strategy for procuring complex professional services. It offers substantial opportunities for well-prepared contractors, both large and small, who can navigate its data-driven requirements and align their capabilities with its domain-based structure. The program's Best-in-Class designation, expansive scope, lack of a contract ceiling, and broad agency access solidify its position as a critical avenue for federal contracting in the years to come.  
The introduction of a continuous open solicitation, or "on-ramping," expected to be fully realized from FY2025, marks a paradigm shift in how contractors will access this vehicle. This mechanism transforms OASIS+ from a series of discrete opportunities into an ongoing consideration, demanding a state of perpetual readiness and continuous market intelligence from the industry. This "new normal" requires contractors to be vigilant, adaptable, and prepared to demonstrate their qualifications whenever they deem themselves ready or when strategic imperatives dictate.  
The OASIS+ landscape is also designed to be dynamic. GSA retains the flexibility to add new Domains or NAICS codes to the contract scope over time, based on evolving government needs. This adaptability ensures that OASIS+ can remain relevant and responsive to the changing requirements of federal agencies throughout its potential 10-year lifespan. For contractors, this means that even after securing an award, ongoing engagement with GSA communications and an awareness of emerging service needs will be crucial for long-term success and potential expansion into new areas.  
Ultimately, contractors who can successfully adapt to the rigorous, data-driven proposal requirements of OASIS+ and embrace the competitive dynamics of a continuous on-ramping environment will be best positioned for sustained success. The program represents a significant evolution in federal procurement, striving for greater efficiency, broader access for qualified contractors (with a strong emphasis on small businesses), and sustained competition to deliver best value for the taxpayer. The long-term success and impact of OASIS+ will be shaped by GSA's effective management of this continuous on-ramping process and by the industry's collective ability to meet and exceed its demanding qualification standards. The vision is one of a highly responsive contracting ecosystem that continuously adapts to federal mission requirements and the evolving capabilities of the industrial base, a stark contrast to more static, traditional IDIQ vehicles.
